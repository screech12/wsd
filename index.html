	<p>Some of us are not sure what to expect if books are no longer used in school. 
	Will we benefit more or less without them? Think about the <em>consequences</em> 
	not having a book to refer to or look back on in later years. You may ask yourself 
	how are the children going to learn how to read. I say this because if the schools 
	go to Ipads, doesn't read it to you? In simple terms the more <em> people</em>
	learn not to learn the worse we are going to be in the future.
	<p>What is going to happen if people for get how to read, write or do mathematics? 
	Will we become <strong>dumb?</strong> It is time for people to start thinking about
	who is going to able to run this country in the future.</p>
