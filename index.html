			<p>Some of us are not sure what to expect if books are no longer used in school. 
			Will we benefit more or less without them? Think about the <em>consequences</em> 
			not having a book to refer to or look back on in later years. You may ask yourself 
			how are the children going to learn how to read. I say this because if the schools 
			go to Ipads, doesn't read it to you? In simple terms the more <em> people</em>
			learn not to learn the worse we are going to be in the future.
			<p>What is going to happen if people for get how to read, write or do mathematics? 
			Will we become <strong>dumb?</strong> It is time for people to start thinking about
			who is going to able to run this country in the future.</p>

 		<p>What are the pros of introducing ipad into the classroom? Could it be a few
 	    less books to carry each day? Fewer books would mean less to carry each day to 
 	    school and easier on your back. Children that do not have access to computers 
 	    will learn how to use them which will increase their ability and preparing them
 	    for real world use of applications. They will also have access to many programs 
 	    that they would not normal be able to afford or use at home.  The use of the 
 	    IPad will encourage students and create curiosity towards learning. Games and 
 	    programs will allow for not only seeing, hearing but also applying the learned 
 	    activities. There seems to be an app for everything these days, and the number 
 	    of educational apps just keeps growing.</p>   
 		<p>Communication tool- You can use them as a polling tool or let students ask 
 		questions or make comments during lectures and address them either as they come
 		or after the lecture. iPad’s ability to quiz students running specialized 
 		software, and calculate classroom results within seconds.There are many apps
 		for students with cognitive disabilities. Apps galore- The iPad has the ability
 		to interact with a variety of apps. There seems to be an app for everything 
 		 these days, and the number of educational apps just keeps growing.</p>
	     <p>These iPads are going to be destroyed in no time. Then who's going to pay 
	     to replace them? If it gets stolen then I have to pay for it? In general there
	     is rarely any work done towards understanding how to integrate the devices in
	     pedagogically sound ways into day-to-day classroom instruction.
