		<p>Some of us are not sure what to expect if books are no longer used in school. 
Will we benefit more or less without them? Think about the <em>consequences</em> 
not having a book to refer to or look back on in later years. You may ask yourself 
how are the children going to learn how to read. I say this because if the schools 
go to Ipads, doesn't read it to you? In simple terms the more <em> people</em>
learn not to learn the worse we are going to be in the future.
		<p>What is going to happen if people for get how to read, write or do mathematics? 
Will we become <strong>dumb?</strong> It is time for people to start thinking about
who is going to able to run this country in the future.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
